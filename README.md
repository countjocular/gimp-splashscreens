# Count Jocular's GIMP splashscreens
Custom splashscreens for the GNU Image Manipulation Program

![The pixelpaint splashscreen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/countjocular/gimp-splashscreens/master/pixelpaint.png)

## Installation

GIMP will use any custom splashscreen you have installed in preference to its
own default. To install, just save the relevant .png image to the `splashes`
directory in your GIMP user directory. For Linux users, this will probably be

> `~/.gimp-2.8/splashes`

The GIMP project has a [more detailed guide](https://www.gimp.org/about/splash/).

## Modification

You can alter these splashscreens using the GIMP itself. Download the .xcf file
and go to town.

## Components

These splashscreens build upon other people's excellent work. Specifically:
